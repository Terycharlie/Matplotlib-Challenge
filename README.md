Observation and Analysis
This analysis was based on 249 mice of which, 49% were female and 51% male mice.
We looked at 10 different drung regimens and of the 10, Proprivia had the least number of mice to complete the study while Capomulin and Ramicane had the highiest numbers of mice to complete the study.
Based on the analysis,Capomulin and Ramicane seem to be the most effective at reducing the tumor size. We looked at mouse x401 which was treated using the Capomulin drug regimen and noticed that the tumor size was reduced from 45.0mm3 to less than 30.0mm3 in approximately 43 days.
There is a strong positive correlation between the mouse weight and the average tumor volume. The correlation is 0.84, which indicates that as the mouse weight increases, there is also an increase in the avarage tumor volume.
